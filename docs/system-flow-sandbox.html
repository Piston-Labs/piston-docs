<h2 id="overview">1. System Overview</h2>

<h3>The Core Concept</h3>
<p>myodo acts as an intelligent broker between three parties:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vehicle Owners</strong> - People who drive cars and need maintenance</li>
<li><strong>Repair Shops</strong> - Independent businesses that service vehicles</li>
<li><strong>The Vehicle Itself</strong> - Via the myodo device, providing real-time data</li>
</ul>

<p>The system's job is to create and maintain connections between these parties, facilitate communication, and ensure the right information reaches the right person at the right time.</p>

<h3>The Universal Key: VIN</h3>
<p>Everything in myodo revolves around the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN). The VIN is a 17-character unique identifier assigned to every vehicle manufactured since 1981. It never changes for the life of the vehicle.</p>

<p>The VIN connects:</p>
<ul>
<li>The myodo device installed in the vehicle</li>
<li>The vehicle owner's account in the myodo app</li>
<li>Every service record ever uploaded for that vehicle</li>
<li>The shop(s) that have serviced that vehicle</li>
<li>Manufacturer maintenance schedules for that specific make/model/year</li>
</ul>

<p>When any piece of data enters the myodo system, the first question is always: <strong>"What VIN does this belong to?"</strong></p>

<h3>Data Sources</h3>
<p>Data enters myodo from three sources:</p>

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Source</th><th>Data Type</th><th>How It Enters</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td><strong>myodo Device</strong></td><td>Mileage, engine data, trip info</td><td>Automatic cellular transmission</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Shop Dashboard</strong></td><td>Service records, repair orders</td><td>Manual upload by shop staff</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Consumer App</strong></td><td>Historical records, preferences</td><td>Photo upload, manual entry</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h2 id="service-record-flow">2. Service Record Upload Flow</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Service Is Performed</h3>
<p>A vehicle owner brings their car to a repair shop. The shop performs work - could be an oil change, brake replacement, tire rotation, major repair, or any combination of services. At the end of the visit, the shop generates a repair order (also called an invoice or work order).</p>

<p>This repair order contains:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shop name and contact information</li>
<li>Date of service</li>
<li>Vehicle information (make, model, year, VIN, license plate, mileage)</li>
<li>Customer information (name, phone, email)</li>
<li>Line items for each service performed</li>
<li>Parts used (part numbers, quantities, prices)</li>
<li>Labor charges (hours, rates)</li>
<li>Totals, taxes, payment information</li>
<li>Technician notes or recommendations</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 2: Shop Uploads the Repair Order</h3>
<p>The shop employee accesses the myodo Shop Dashboard and uploads the repair order. This can happen in several ways:</p>

<h4>Method A: PDF Upload (Most Common)</h4>
<ol>
<li>Shop exports repair order as PDF from their shop management system (ShopGenie, Tekmetric, Mitchell, etc.)</li>
<li>Shop employee drags and drops the PDF into the myodo dashboard</li>
<li>myodo receives the file and queues it for processing</li>
</ol>

<h4>Method B: Photo Upload</h4>
<ol>
<li>Shop employee takes a photo of the printed repair order</li>
<li>Photo is uploaded via the dashboard or mobile app</li>
<li>myodo receives the image and queues it for processing</li>
</ol>

<h4>Method C: Direct Integration (Future)</h4>
<ol>
<li>Shop management system has API integration with myodo</li>
<li>When repair order is finalized, it automatically syncs to myodo</li>
<li>No manual upload required</li>
</ol>

<h3>Step 3: AI Document Processing</h3>
<p>When myodo receives a repair order (PDF or image), the AI processing pipeline activates:</p>

<h4>3a. Document Intake</h4>
<ul>
<li>File is received and stored in secure cloud storage</li>
<li>File is assigned a unique document ID</li>
<li>Metadata is recorded: upload timestamp, uploading shop ID, file type, file size</li>
</ul>

<h4>3b. Text Extraction</h4>
<ul>
<li>For PDFs: Text is extracted directly from the PDF structure</li>
<li>For images: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) converts the image to text</li>
<li>The raw extracted text is stored for processing</li>
</ul>

<h4>3c. VIN Detection</h4>
<ul>
<li>AI scans the extracted text looking for a valid VIN</li>
<li>VINs follow a specific pattern: 17 characters, specific character positions have meaning</li>
<li>If found, the VIN is validated against known patterns</li>
<li>If no VIN is found, the system attempts to identify the vehicle via make/model/year + license plate</li>
<li>If vehicle cannot be identified, the upload is flagged for manual review</li>
</ul>

<h4>3d. Data Extraction</h4>
<p>The AI extracts structured data from the unstructured document:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Service Date</strong> - When the work was performed</li>
<li><strong>Mileage at Service</strong> - Odometer reading at time of service</li>
<li><strong>Services Performed</strong> - Each line item (oil change, brake pads, etc.)</li>
<li><strong>Parts Used</strong> - Part numbers, descriptions, quantities</li>
<li><strong>Labor Details</strong> - Hours, rates, descriptions</li>
<li><strong>Costs</strong> - Parts costs, labor costs, totals</li>
<li><strong>Technician Recommendations</strong> - "Recommend replacing tires at next visit"</li>
<li><strong>Customer Information</strong> - Name, phone, email (if present)</li>
</ul>

<h4>3e. Data Normalization</h4>
<p>Different shops describe the same service in different ways. The AI normalizes this:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Oil Change" = "Lube, Oil, Filter" = "LOF" = "Engine Oil Service"</li>
<li>"Brake Pads - Front" = "Front Brake Pad Replacement" = "Fr Brake Pads"</li>
<li>All variations are mapped to standard service categories</li>
</ul>

<h4>3f. Confidence Scoring</h4>
<ul>
<li>Each extracted field gets a confidence score (0-100%)</li>
<li>High confidence fields are accepted automatically</li>
<li>Low confidence fields may be flagged for human review</li>
<li>Overall document confidence determines if manual review is needed</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 4: Record Storage</h3>
<p>Once processed, the service record is stored in the myodo database:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Primary Key:</strong> VIN + Service Date + Shop ID</li>
<li><strong>Indexed Fields:</strong> VIN, Shop ID, Service Date, Service Types</li>
<li><strong>Original Document:</strong> Stored as reference (never deleted)</li>
<li><strong>Extracted Data:</strong> Stored in structured format for querying</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 5: Relationship Linking</h3>
<p>After storage, the system checks for and creates relationships:</p>

<h4>5a. Vehicle-Shop Link</h4>
<ul>
<li>If this is the first time this shop has serviced this VIN, a new shop-vehicle relationship is created</li>
<li>If the relationship already exists, the "last service date" is updated</li>
<li>The shop is now the "most recent service provider" for this vehicle</li>
</ul>

<h4>5b. Vehicle-Owner Link (If Device Exists)</h4>
<ul>
<li>System checks: Is there a myodo device registered to this VIN?</li>
<li>If yes: The service record is linked to the vehicle owner's account</li>
<li>If no: The record is stored but not linked to any consumer account (yet)</li>
</ul>

<h4>5c. Consumer Notification (If Linked)</h4>
<ul>
<li>If the vehicle owner has a myodo account and has opted into notifications:</li>
<li>A push notification is sent: "New service record added: [Service Type] at [Shop Name]"</li>
<li>The record appears in their app under Service History</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2 id="device-telemetry-flow">3. Device Telemetry Flow</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Device Installation</h3>
<p>The vehicle owner (or a shop employee) installs the myodo device:</p>

<ol>
<li>Locate the OBD-II port (under the dashboard, driver's side, near the steering column)</li>
<li>Plug the myodo device into the port</li>
<li>The device powers on automatically (draws power from the vehicle's 12V system)</li>
<li>LED indicator shows status (blinking = connecting, solid = connected)</li>
</ol>

<h3>Step 2: Device Registration</h3>
<p>The device must be registered to a vehicle owner's account:</p>

<ol>
<li>Vehicle owner opens the myodo app</li>
<li>Selects "Add Device"</li>
<li>Scans the QR code on the device (or manually enters the device serial number)</li>
<li>The app sends a registration request to the myodo backend</li>
<li>The backend associates the device serial number with the user's account</li>
</ol>

<h3>Step 3: VIN Auto-Detection</h3>
<p>Once plugged in, the device reads the vehicle's VIN:</p>

<ol>
<li>Device sends a request over the OBD-II protocol asking for the VIN</li>
<li>The vehicle's onboard computer responds with the 17-character VIN</li>
<li>Device transmits the VIN to myodo servers</li>
<li>The VIN is validated and associated with the device and user account</li>
<li>The vehicle's make, model, year, and engine are decoded from the VIN</li>
<li>Manufacturer maintenance schedules for this specific vehicle are loaded</li>
</ol>

<h3>Step 4: Continuous Data Collection</h3>
<p>While the device is installed, it continuously collects data:</p>

<h4>When the Vehicle is Running:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Every 1 second:</strong> GPS coordinates captured (for distance calculation)</li>
<li><strong>Every 5 seconds:</strong> Speed, RPM, engine load recorded</li>
<li><strong>Every 60 seconds:</strong> Data packet assembled and transmitted to myodo servers</li>
</ul>

<h4>Data Packet Contents:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Device ID</li>
<li>Timestamp</li>
<li>Current odometer reading</li>
<li>Trip distance since last transmission</li>
<li>Current speed</li>
<li>Engine RPM</li>
<li>Coolant temperature</li>
<li>Battery voltage</li>
<li>Fuel level (if available)</li>
<li>Check engine light status</li>
<li>Any diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs)</li>
</ul>

<h4>When the Vehicle is Parked:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Device enters low-power mode</li>
<li>Transmits a "heartbeat" packet every 4 hours</li>
<li>Heartbeat confirms device is still connected and vehicle battery status</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 5: Data Transmission</h3>
<p>The device sends data to myodo servers via cellular connection:</p>

<ol>
<li>Device has a built-in cellular modem with pre-installed SIM card</li>
<li>Connects to available cellular network (multi-carrier, chooses strongest signal)</li>
<li>Data is encrypted before transmission</li>
<li>Transmitted to myodo ingestion servers</li>
<li>Server acknowledges receipt</li>
<li>If transmission fails, data is buffered on-device (up to 7 days of storage)</li>
</ol>

<h3>Step 6: Server-Side Processing</h3>
<p>When data arrives at myodo servers:</p>

<h4>6a. Authentication</h4>
<ul>
<li>Device ID is verified against registered devices</li>
<li>Cryptographic signature is validated</li>
<li>Invalid or unregistered devices are rejected</li>
</ul>

<h4>6b. GPS Processing (Privacy-Critical)</h4>
<ul>
<li>GPS coordinates are used ONLY to calculate distance traveled</li>
<li>Distance is added to running trip total</li>
<li><strong>GPS coordinates are then immediately discarded</strong></li>
<li>Only the distance value is stored, never the location</li>
</ul>

<h4>6c. Odometer Update</h4>
<ul>
<li>New odometer reading is compared to previous reading</li>
<li>Sanity check: Is the increase reasonable? (Can't go backward, can't jump 10,000 miles)</li>
<li>If valid, vehicle's odometer record is updated</li>
<li>Mileage history is logged (date + odometer reading)</li>
</ul>

<h4>6d. Service Interval Calculation</h4>
<ul>
<li>Current odometer is compared against service schedules</li>
<li>For each maintenance item (oil change, tire rotation, etc.):</li>
<li>Calculate: Miles since last service of this type</li>
<li>Compare to: Recommended interval for this vehicle</li>
<li>Determine: Miles remaining until service is due</li>
</ul>

<h4>6e. Alert Generation</h4>
<ul>
<li>If any service is within threshold (default: 500 miles), flag for notification</li>
<li>If check engine light is on, flag for immediate notification</li>
<li>If battery voltage is low, flag for notification</li>
<li>Alerts are queued for the notification system</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="vehicle-profile-linking">4. Vehicle Profile & Linking</h2>

<h3>The Vehicle Profile</h3>
<p>Every vehicle in myodo has a profile, which is the central record that connects everything:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>VIN</strong> - The unique identifier</li>
<li><strong>Decoded Vehicle Info</strong> - Year, Make, Model, Engine, Trim</li>
<li><strong>Current Odometer</strong> - Most recent known mileage</li>
<li><strong>Service History</strong> - All uploaded service records</li>
<li><strong>Maintenance Schedule</strong> - Manufacturer-recommended service intervals</li>
<li><strong>Service Status</strong> - What's due, what's coming up, what's overdue</li>
<li><strong>Linked Device</strong> - If a myodo device is installed</li>
<li><strong>Linked Owner</strong> - If a consumer has claimed this vehicle</li>
<li><strong>Linked Shops</strong> - Shops that have serviced this vehicle</li>
</ul>

<h3>How Linking Works</h3>

<h4>Scenario A: Device First, Then Service</h4>
<ol>
<li>Consumer buys myodo device and installs it</li>
<li>Device registers VIN to consumer's account</li>
<li>Vehicle profile is created (or existing orphan profile is claimed)</li>
<li>Consumer takes car to a shop for service</li>
<li>Shop uploads repair order</li>
<li>myodo detects: "This VIN has a registered owner"</li>
<li>Service record is automatically linked to consumer's account</li>
<li>Consumer sees record in their app immediately</li>
<li>Shop is now linked as a service provider for this vehicle</li>
</ol>

<h4>Scenario B: Service First, Then Device</h4>
<ol>
<li>Consumer takes car to a myodo-connected shop</li>
<li>Shop uploads repair order</li>
<li>myodo creates a vehicle profile for this VIN (orphan profile - no owner)</li>
<li>Service record is stored, linked to vehicle profile</li>
<li>Later, consumer buys and installs myodo device</li>
<li>Device reads VIN during registration</li>
<li>myodo detects: "This VIN already has service history"</li>
<li>Existing vehicle profile is linked to consumer's account</li>
<li>All previous service records now appear in consumer's app</li>
<li>Consumer "inherits" the service history</li>
</ol>

<h4>Scenario C: Consumer Uploads Historical Records</h4>
<ol>
<li>Consumer has myodo device installed</li>
<li>Consumer has old service records (paper, email, photos)</li>
<li>Consumer uploads these via the myodo app</li>
<li>AI processes and extracts data</li>
<li>VIN is matched to consumer's vehicle</li>
<li>Historical records are added to the vehicle's service history</li>
<li>Service intervals are recalculated based on complete history</li>
</ol>

<h3>The Shop-Consumer Connection</h3>
<p>When a shop services a vehicle with a myodo device, a relationship is created:</p>

<ul>
<li>The shop can see: This vehicle exists, its service history (at their shop only), upcoming service needs</li>
<li>The shop cannot see: Consumer's personal details, service history at other shops, location data</li>
<li>The consumer can see: The shop's name, contact info, their service history at that shop</li>
<li>The consumer controls: Whether the shop can contact them, what data is shared</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2 id="service-notification-flow">5. Service Notification Flow</h2>

<h3>Trigger: Service Approaching</h3>
<p>The notification system constantly monitors all vehicles with active devices:</p>

<ol>
<li>Every time new mileage data arrives, service intervals are recalculated</li>
<li>If a service item crosses the notification threshold, an alert is triggered</li>
<li>Default threshold: 500 miles before service is due</li>
<li>Consumer can customize thresholds (250 miles, 1000 miles, etc.)</li>
</ol>

<h3>Notification Content Generation</h3>
<p>When a notification is triggered, the system generates the message:</p>

<h4>Information Gathered:</h4>
<ul>
<li>What service is due (e.g., "Oil Change")</li>
<li>Miles until due (e.g., "487 miles")</li>
<li>Most recent shop for this vehicle (e.g., "Joe's Auto Repair")</li>
<li>Consumer's notification preferences (push, email, SMS)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Message Constructed:</h4>
<blockquote><p>"Your [Vehicle Year Make Model] is due for an oil change in about 500 miles. Schedule with Joe's Auto Repair?"</p></blockquote>

<h3>Notification Delivery</h3>

<h4>Push Notification (Primary)</h4>
<ol>
<li>Message is sent to Apple Push Notification Service (iOS) or Firebase Cloud Messaging (Android)</li>
<li>Consumer's phone receives the notification</li>
<li>Notification appears on lock screen and in notification center</li>
<li>Tapping the notification opens the myodo app to the scheduling screen</li>
</ol>

<h4>Email Notification (Secondary)</h4>
<ol>
<li>If consumer has email notifications enabled:</li>
<li>Email is generated with service details</li>
<li>Includes "Schedule Now" button linking to the app</li>
<li>Sent via email delivery service</li>
</ol>

<h4>SMS Notification (Optional)</h4>
<ol>
<li>If consumer has SMS notifications enabled:</li>
<li>Short message is generated</li>
<li>Sent via SMS gateway</li>
<li>Includes link to schedule</li>
</ol>

<h3>Notification Frequency Controls</h3>
<p>To prevent notification fatigue:</p>

<ul>
<li>Same service type: Maximum one notification per 7 days</li>
<li>Total notifications: Maximum 3 per week per vehicle</li>
<li>Consumer can snooze: "Remind me in 1 week"</li>
<li>Consumer can dismiss: "I've already scheduled this"</li>
<li>Consumer can disable: Turn off notifications for specific service types</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2 id="scheduling-flow">6. Scheduling System Flow</h2>

<h3>Consumer Initiates Scheduling</h3>
<p>From the notification or from the app, the consumer decides to schedule:</p>

<ol>
<li>Consumer taps "Schedule" button</li>

<h2 id="data-privacy-flow">8. Data Privacy & Consent Flow</h2>

<h3>Consumer Data Ownership</h3>
<p>Fundamental principle: <strong>The consumer owns their data.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Service records belong to the consumer, not the shop</li>
<li>Mileage data belongs to the consumer, not myodo</li>
<li>The consumer decides what to share and with whom</li>
</ul>

<h3>Consent Levels</h3>

<h4>Level 1: Account Creation</h4>
<p>Consumer agrees to:</p>
<ul>
<li>myodo Terms of Service</li>
<li>Privacy Policy</li>
<li>Data processing for service functionality</li>
</ul>

<h4>Level 2: Device Registration</h4>
<p>Consumer agrees to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collection of vehicle telemetry data</li>
<li>Use of GPS for mileage calculation (not storage)</li>
<li>Transmission of data via cellular network</li>
</ul>

<h4>Level 3: Shop Connection</h4>
<p>When a shop services their vehicle, consumer is notified:</p>
<ul>
<li>"[Shop Name] uploaded a service record for your vehicle"</li>
<li>"[Shop Name] can now see your service history at their shop"</li>
<li>Consumer can disconnect the shop at any time</li>
</ul>

<h4>Level 4: Data Sharing (Per-Request)</h4>
<p>When consumer schedules with a new shop:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consumer chooses what to share: Full history? Just basics?</li>
<li>Sharing is revocable at any time</li>
<li>Shop only sees what consumer explicitly shared</li>
</ul>

<h3>Data Deletion Rights</h3>

<h4>Delete Specific Records</h4>
<p>Consumer can delete individual service records:</p>
<ul>
<li>Record is removed from consumer's visible history</li>
<li>Record is flagged as deleted (not shown to shops)</li>
<li>Original document may be retained for legal compliance (configurable)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Delete Account</h4>
<p>Consumer can delete their entire account:</p>
<ul>
<li>All personal data is removed from active systems</li>
<li>Device is deregistered</li>
<li>Backup copies are purged within 30 days</li>
<li>Anonymized aggregate data may be retained for analytics</li>
</ul>

<h3>Shop Data Access</h3>
<p>Shops have limited data access by design:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Can see:</strong> Vehicles they have serviced, service history at their shop</li>
<li><strong>Cannot see:</strong> Service history at other shops, consumer personal data (until appointment confirmed), location history (doesn't exist)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Summary: The myodo Value Loop</h2>

<p>The complete system creates a virtuous cycle:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Device tracks mileage</strong> → Enables accurate service predictions</li>
<li><strong>Accurate predictions</strong> → Consumer trusts notifications</li>
<li><strong>Consumer trusts notifications</strong> → Consumer schedules service</li>
<li><strong>Consumer schedules service</strong> → Shop retains customer</li>
<li><strong>Shop retains customer</strong> → Shop uploads records</li>
<li><strong>Shop uploads records</strong> → Better service history</li>
<li><strong>Better service history</strong> → More accurate predictions</li>
<li><strong>Repeat</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>myodo sits at the center of this loop, facilitating every connection while ensuring the consumer maintains control of their data and relationships.</p>

<h2 id="elevator-pitch">Investor Elevator Pitch</h2>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>What We Do:</strong> myodo is the intelligence layer between vehicles and repair shops. We broker the relationship - tracking real mileage, storing service history, and connecting drivers to shops at exactly the right moment.</p>

<p><strong>How It Works:</strong> A small device plugs into your car and reports mileage to our system. We combine that with service records from shops. When maintenance is actually due, we notify the driver and route them back to their shop. One tap to schedule.</p>

<p><strong>Why We Win:</strong> We sit in the middle. Drivers get accurate reminders and a complete service history. Shops get customers who come back. We're the broker that makes both sides better off.</p>

<p><strong>The Business:</strong> $150 device, $15/month for drivers. Free dashboard for shops, $100/month Pro tier. $25/month for fleets. Same device, same backend, three revenue streams.</p>

<p><strong>The Ask:</strong> $500K on a $5M cap. 12-month runway to 300 devices, 20 shops, $65K ARR.</p>
