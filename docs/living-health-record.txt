DISPLAY PRINCIPLES
==================

1. PROGRESSIVE DISCLOSURE
   - Level 1: Category summary (Brakes: "1 item to monitor")
   - Level 2: Item list with status (Front Pads: 7mm, Rear Pads: 4mm)
   - Level 3: Full technician notes (what they actually wrote)

2. STATUS COLORS
   - Green = OK, no action needed
   - Yellow = Monitor, may need attention soon
   - Red = Service Required, needs action

3. NO DIRECT RECOMMENDATIONS
   - We state facts and cite industry sources
   - Actual service recommendations come from the shop
   - Example: "6 years old. Industry guidelines suggest inspection after 5 years."

4. TECHNICIAN NOTES
   - Show the raw notes from the inspection
   - Include inspector name and shop
   - Builds trust through transparency


DESIGN DECISION: HANDLING MISSING DATA
======================================

When we only have partial inspection data (e.g., brakes and tires but not fluids):

OPTION A: Only Show What We Have
- Only display categories with data
- Pros: Clean, focused, builds confidence in what IS shown
- Cons: User doesn't know what COULD be shown, may wonder "did they check my battery?"

OPTION B: Show Everything with "Not Inspected"
- Always show all categories, mark empty ones as "Not inspected"
- Pros: Transparent about gaps, shows full inspection capability
- Cons: Looks incomplete, may undermine confidence

OPTION C: Hybrid (Recommended)
- Show all categories
- Auto-expand categories WITH data
- Collapse categories without data, show "Not inspected" in gray
- User can tap empty categories to see what COULD be there
- Pros: Focus on what we have while showing scope
- Cons: Slightly more complex

DECISION NEEDED: Which approach for beta?


FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS
=====================

1. History View - Show how items changed over multiple inspections
2. Comparison Bars - Visual spectrum showing where measurement falls
3. Push Notifications - Alert when status changes (green → yellow)
4. Quick Actions - "Schedule Service" button that pre-fills the issue
5. Shop Integration - Link back to shop for follow-up
