TIRE AGE EDUCATION
==================
Tire age is tracked via the DOT code on the sidewall. The last 4 digits indicate
week and year of manufacture. Example: "2419" = Week 24 of 2019.

Why Tire Age Matters:
- Tires degrade over time due to environmental factors, even when not in use
- Rubber compounds break down, leading to dry rot and cracking
- Industry guidelines (NHTSA, tire manufacturers):
  - Inspect annually after 5 years of service
  - 6-10 years is typical service life range
  - Actual condition depends on wear, storage, and climate

Display Approach:
- Show age in years with DOT code reference
- Visual timeline showing where tire falls on 0-10 year spectrum
- Educational "Learn more" content explaining why age matters
- Always defer to shop for actual condition assessment


DISPLAY PRINCIPLES
==================

1. PROGRESSIVE DISCLOSURE
   The Core Idea: Users should feel confident about their vehicle's health at a glance,
   without being overwhelmed by technical details. Details are available on-demand.

   Level 1: Category Summary (Default View)
   - User sees list of categories (Brakes, Fluids, Tires, etc.)
   - Each category shows high-level status:
     - "All OK" (green) - Everything in this category is green
     - "X items to monitor" (yellow) - Some items need attention soon
     - "X needs service" (red) - At least one item requires action
   - Answers "do I need to worry about anything?" in 2 seconds

   Level 2: Item List (Category Expanded)
   - Tap category to see all items within it
   - Each item shows: name, status value, color
   - Example: "Front Pads: 7mm (green)", "Rear Pads: 4mm (yellow)"

   Level 3: Technician Notes (Item Expanded)
   - Tap item to see raw technician notes
   - Shows exactly what technician observed/measured
   - Includes inspector name and shop
   - "Show me exactly what they found" layer

2. STATUS COLORS
   - Green = OK, no action needed
   - Yellow = Monitor, may need attention soon
   - Red = Service Required, needs action
   - Based on industry-standard DVI (Digital Vehicle Inspection) colors

3. NO DIRECT RECOMMENDATIONS
   - We state facts and cite industry sources
   - Actual service recommendations come from the shop
   - Example: "6 years old. Industry guidelines suggest inspection after 5 years."
   - Builds trust by being informative without being prescriptive

4. TECHNICIAN NOTES
   - Show the raw notes from the inspection
   - Include inspector name and shop
   - Builds trust through transparency
   - Differentiates us from black-box "your car needs X" apps


USER PSYCHOLOGY
===============

Confidence Without Overload
- Most users don't want to read 29 inspection items
- They want to know: "Is my car okay?"
- Category summary answers that question in 2 seconds
- Power users can dig deeper into details

Actionable, Not Alarming
- Yellow items should feel like "something to keep an eye on" - not scary
- Red items are "you should handle this soon"
- Language should be specific enough to act on, without being alarmist
- Avoid fear-based messaging

Trust Through Transparency
- Showing actual technician notes builds trust
- Users can see exact language the shop used
- Can verify measurements and understand context
- Differentiates from apps that just say "your car needs X" with no explanation


IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS
===========================

Data Model Extensions
- Each item needs optional techNotes field:
  - techNotes.raw - Original text from shop's inspection report
  - techNotes.inspectedBy - Technician name (if available)
  - techNotes.shopName - Shop that performed the inspection

Category Aggregation Logic
- Category status badge priority:
  1. If ANY item is "service_required" → Show "X needs service" (red)
  2. Else if ANY item is "monitor" → Show "X items to monitor" (yellow)
  3. Else → Show "All OK" (green)

Empty State Handling
- If item has no technician notes, show placeholder:
  - "No additional notes from this inspection"
  - Still show inspector/shop if available


ACCESSIBILITY REQUIREMENTS
==========================
- Don't rely on color alone - always include text status ("OK", "Monitor", "Service Required")
- Expandable sections need proper aria-expanded attributes
- Screen readers should announce category name AND status together
- Ensure sufficient color contrast (yellow on dark backgrounds needs attention)
- Tap targets should be large enough for mobile (minimum 44px height)


DESIGN DECISION: HANDLING MISSING DATA
======================================

When we only have partial inspection data (e.g., brakes and tires but not fluids):

OPTION A: Only Show What We Have
- Only display categories with data
- Pros: Clean, focused, builds confidence in what IS shown
- Cons: User doesn't know what COULD be shown, may wonder "did they check my battery?"

OPTION B: Show Everything with "Not Inspected"
- Always show all categories, mark empty ones as "Not inspected"
- Pros: Transparent about gaps, shows full inspection capability
- Cons: Looks incomplete, may undermine confidence

OPTION C: Hybrid (Recommended)
- Show all categories
- Auto-expand categories WITH data
- Collapse categories without data, show "Not inspected" in gray
- User can tap empty categories to see what COULD be there
- Pros: Focus on what we have while showing scope
- Cons: Slightly more complex

DECISION NEEDED: Which approach for beta?


FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS
=====================

1. History View
   - Users should see how an item changed over time
   - Example: "Rear brakes went from 7mm → 5mm → 4mm over 3 inspections"
   - Requires storing historical snapshots per VIN

2. Comparison to Industry Standards
   - Show where user's measurement falls on a visual spectrum
   - Example: Tire age bar showing 6 years on a 0-10 year scale with color zones
   - Provides context without being prescriptive

3. Push Notifications
   - Alert when new inspection comes in
   - Especially notify if status changed (green → yellow, or yellow → red)
   - Keep user informed without requiring them to check

4. Quick Actions
   - On items needing attention, offer "Schedule Service" button
   - Pre-fills the issue into a service request
   - Routes to the shop that performed the inspection

5. Shop Integration
   - Link back to shop for follow-up questions
   - Easy re-booking for recommended services
   - Maintain shop-customer relationship
