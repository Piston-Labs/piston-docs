<h1>myodo Product Guide</h1>
<p><strong>Your car. Your records. Your choice.</strong></p>

<p>myodo helps you stay on top of vehicle maintenance without the hassle. Know when service is actually due based on how you drive, keep all your records in one place, and connect with repair shops on your terms.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="myodo-device">The myodo Device</h2>

<h3>What It Does</h3>
<p>The myodo device plugs into your car and tracks your actual mileage. That's it. No complicated setup, no monthly data plans to manage, no tracking your location.</p>

<p>It takes about 30 seconds to install - just plug it into the port under your dashboard (every car made after 1996 has one). Once it's in, you can forget about it. The device syncs with your myodo app automatically.</p>

<h3>Why Mileage Matters</h3>
<p>Most service reminders are based on time: "It's been 6 months, maybe get an oil change?" But that's a guess. If you drive 2,000 miles a month, you need service more often than someone who drives 500.</p>

<p>myodo knows your actual miles. So instead of guessing, you get reminders when service is actually due - not too early, not too late.</p>

<h3>Privacy By Design</h3>
<p>Here's what myodo does differently: <strong>we don't store your location</strong>.</p>

<p>The device uses GPS to calculate distance, then immediately discards the location data. We know you drove 47 miles today. We don't know where you went.</p>

<p>Why? Because we don't need to know. And because your driving habits are nobody's business but yours.</p>

<h3>What's Included</h3>
<ul>
<li>myodo device (plugs into your car)</li>
<li>Cellular connectivity included (no extra fees)</li>
<li>Works in any car from 1996 or newer</li>
<li>Built to last 10+ years</li>
</ul>

<h3>Price</h3>
<p><strong>$150</strong> (one-time purchase)</p>

<h2 id="myodo-app">The myodo App</h2>

<h3>For Drivers</h3>

<p>The myodo app is your car's command center. Everything about your vehicle - maintenance history, upcoming service, records from every shop - all in one place.</p>

<h4>Know When Service Is Due</h4>
<p>No more guessing. myodo tracks your real mileage and tells you when maintenance is actually needed.</p>

<p><em>"You have 500 miles until your next oil change."</em></p>

<p>That's a notification you can actually use. Schedule when it's convenient for you - not when your car breaks down.</p>

<h4>All Your Records, One Place</h4>
<p>Ever tried to find your service records? They're scattered across gloveboxes, email inboxes, and repair shops you haven't visited in years.</p>

<p>myodo fixes that:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Automatic imports</strong> - Records from myodo-connected shops appear automatically</li>
<li><strong>Photo uploads</strong> - Snap a picture of any old receipt or invoice</li>
<li><strong>AI-powered organization</strong> - We read your receipts and organize everything by service type, date, and cost</li>
<li><strong>Lifetime access</strong> - Your records stay with you, even if you switch shops</li>
</ul>

<h4>Book Service in One Tap</h4>
<p>When it's time for service, booking is easy:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get a notification that service is due</li>
<li>Tap "Schedule"</li>
<li>Pick a time that works</li>
<li>Done</li>
</ol>

<p>Your preferred shop is always the default. No searching, no phone calls, no waiting on hold.</p>

<h4>Your Data, Your Control</h4>
<p>You decide who sees your vehicle information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share your service history with a shop before an appointment</li>
<li>Revoke access anytime</li>
<li>Export everything if you want to leave</li>
<li>Delete your account and all data permanently</li>
</ul>

<p>No cold calls. No spam. Shops only know about you when you choose to connect with them.</p>

<h3>Price</h3>
<p><strong>$15/month</strong> or <strong>$150/year</strong> (2 months free)</p>

<h2 id="shop-dashboard">For Repair Shops</h2>

<h3>The Problem We Solve</h3>
<p>Independent repair shops lose 60% of customers after the first visit. Not because of bad service - because there's no easy way to stay connected. The customer drives away, forgets about you, and ends up at the dealer or wherever's most convenient next time.</p>

<h3>How myodo Helps</h3>
<p>When your customers use myodo, you stay connected automatically:</p>

<ol>
<li>Customer visits your shop</li>
<li>You upload the repair order (drag and drop, takes 10 seconds)</li>
<li>Time passes, customer drives</li>
<li>myodo detects service is due</li>
<li>Customer gets a reminder: <em>"Schedule with [Your Shop]?"</em></li>
<li>Customer taps to book</li>
<li>You get the appointment</li>
</ol>

<p>No marketing campaigns. No email lists. No CRM workflows. The system runs in the background while you focus on fixing cars.</p>

<h3>Free Features</h3>
<p>Every shop gets these at no cost:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unlimited record uploads</strong> - PDF, photo, or manual entry</li>
<li><strong>Automatic customer linking</strong> - Connect with customers who use myodo</li>
<li><strong>Incoming appointments</strong> - Receive booking requests from customers</li>
<li><strong>Customer list</strong> - See all your connected customers and their vehicles</li>
</ul>

<h3>Pro Features ($100/month)</h3>
<p>For shops ready to do more:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Calendar sync</strong> - Customers see your real availability and book open slots</li>
<li><strong>Direct messaging</strong> - Send updates, photos, and quotes through the app</li>
<li><strong>Analytics</strong> - Track retention, revenue, and service trends</li>
<li><strong>Team access</strong> - Add service advisors with their own logins</li>
</ul>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<ol>
<li>Sign up at dashboard.myodo.com</li>
<li>Add your shop info</li>
<li>Upload your first repair order</li>
<li>That's it - you're connected</li>
</ol>

<p>Recommend myodo devices to your customers, and you'll stay top-of-mind every time they need service.</p>

<li><strong>Restricted areas</strong> - Flag unauthorized locations</li>
