INSPECTION TAXONOMY
===================
Semantic mapping for parsing shop inspection language into Living Health Record schema.

PURPOSE
-------
This document maps the subjective, variable language technicians use in inspection reports
to our standardized schema. Used for vector RAG semantic matching to automatically
classify inspection findings.


HOW IT WORKS
------------
1. Shop sends inspection report (free text, PDF, or structured data)
2. Vector RAG matches phrases to taxonomy entries
3. System maps to schema path and determines status (ok/monitor/service_required)
4. Data populates the Living Health Record


STATUS LEVELS
-------------
- OK (Green): No action needed, within acceptable range
- Monitor (Yellow): May need attention soon, keep an eye on it
- Service Required (Red): Needs action, should be addressed


TWO ITEM TYPES
--------------
QUANTITATIVE - Extract numeric values (mm, 32nds, volts, PSI). Status derived from thresholds.
  Example: "Front pads at 4mm" → Extract 4, compare to threshold (3-5mm = monitor)

STATUS-BASED - Map descriptive language to OK / Monitor / Service Required.
  Example: "Oil looks dark" → Match "dark" to monitor status

CRITICAL SEVERITY DISTINCTIONS
==============================

LEAKS: Seep vs Leak
-------------------
Severity spectrum: Seep → Weep → Leak → Active Leak

- Seep/Seepage = moisture, staining, oily film - NOT actively moving
  → STATUS: Monitor

- Weep/Weeping = slow fluid migration, damp, sweating
  → STATUS: Monitor

- Leak/Drip = active dripping, drops forming
  → STATUS: Service Required

- Active/Major Leak = running, puddle, pooling, rapid loss
  → STATUS: Service Required

Key rule: If it's not actively dripping, it's monitor. Once fluid is moving/dripping, it's service required.


BELTS: Chirp vs Squeal
----------------------
- Chirp/Chirping = minor noise, often cold start or moisture related
  → STATUS: Monitor

- Squeal/Squealing = significant slipping, tension issue, constant noise
  → STATUS: Service Required


ROTORS: Scoring Severity
------------------------
- Light scoring, minor grooves, surface scoring
  → STATUS: Monitor (can often be resurfaced)

- Deeply grooved, warped, pulsating, below spec
  → STATUS: Service Required (replace)

PARSING NOTES
================================================================================

NEGATION HANDLING
-----------------
"No leaks" → OK
"Leaks" → Service Required
Context matters. The phrase "no" before a negative condition indicates OK status.


ACTION VS CONDITION
-------------------
"Topped off" - Action was taken, implies it was low → Monitor
"Replaced" - Action taken, current status is now OK
"Adjusted" - May indicate it was out of spec → context dependent


COMPOUND STATEMENTS
-------------------
"Brakes and tires good" - Single note covering multiple items
Requires sentence-level parsing to split into multiple schema entries.


CONDITIONAL/TEMPORAL PHRASES
----------------------------
"ok for now" → Monitor (implies future concern)
"good until next service" → OK with note
"will need soon" → Monitor
